# Constructor method: dataLoader()

The first step is to construct a DataLoader class object, from which you could access all the class's methods. To do so we use the constructor method as follows:

```{r eval=FALSE}
objDL= dataLoader()
```


The consturctor admit the following parameters:

 -	**param verbose.mode**: boolean. If TRUE some messages will appear in console, during the computation; otherwise the computation will be silent.
 -	**param save.memory**: boolean. If TRUE, dataLoader() avoid to keep in memory the entire original csv.
 -	**param max.char.length.label**: numeric. It defines the max length of the event name strings.
Once create the Data Loader object it is possible to run all its function as elements of the data loader object list. 

Once the dataLoader object has been created, it is possible to load Event Log using one of the two methods provided by the DataLoaderclass, which are  _load.csv()_ function and  _load.data.frame()_ function.
